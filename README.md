# Point2Real
The official implementation of Point2Real (AAAI 2024).

**Coming Soon...**

## Introduction
We propose Point2Real, a training-free framework based on the realistic rendering technique to automate the transformation of the 3D point cloud domain into the Vision-Language domain. Specifically, Point2Real leverages a shape recovery module that devises an iterative ball-pivoting algorithm to convert point clouds into meshes, narrowing the gap in shape at first. To simulate photo-realistic images, a set of refined textures as candidates is applied for rendering, where the CLIP confidence is utilized to select the suitable one. Moreover, to tackle the viewpoint challenge, a heuristic multi-view adapter is implemented for feature aggregation, which exploits the depth surface as an effective indicator of view-specific discriminability for recognition. We conduct experiments on ModelNet10, ModelNet40, and ScanObjectNN datasets, and the results demonstrate that Point2Real outperforms other approaches in zero-shot and few-shot tasks by a large margin.
